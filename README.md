## OBJECTIVE

Programmer / Software Engineer

## SUMMARY

My whole coding career is described in the following projects:

- E-commerce Business Card System
- Auto Specification Generation System
- Penetration Test and preparation for the ISMS inspection
- Data Network Architecture(DNA)
- Mail Publishing System 
- Point System
- Payment Gateway

## E-commerce Business Card System

  Since March 2012, at Xecys Inc., I was dedicated to the E-commerce Business Card System(EBCS).
With the Visual Studio IDE, coding and maintenance of Business Card Publishing Software in C#, ASP.NET.
At that time the data and program had been dependent on each other, so the system has low maintainability because of its verbosity.
Therefore, my strategy was to extract patterns of the Business Card layout and relating data, then created my own language and its interpreter
which makes its system safer and shorter. My DSL-based refactoring project succeeded in alienating manufacture and duplication of data out of the hands of developers.
In EBCS, I also handled Windows-Server Configuration, YAMAHA router configuration, VM setup, Debian/Ubuntu installation and its network configuration, et cetra.      	

## Auto Specification Generation System

  Since 2013, In the project, my task was to design the conversion system of Excel-Based specification into a database.
Parsing and Analyzing its data. The system was made in Scala.

## Penetration Test and preparation for the ISMS inspection

   Since 2014, I was assigned to the penetration test and document setup for the security inspection by JPMorgan Inc.,
So I made scripts for the penetration test in Python, and prepared to the inspection according as the ISMS criteria.  After that, with CEO, my mission was to attend meetings with JPMorgan agent from India, answered bunch of questions.  

## Data Network Architecture

   Since 2014, at Gurunavi Inc., I was dedicated to the maintenance and development of the system called Data Network Architecture(DNA), which handled JSON-based system communicates with the NoSQL database(Cassandra).  In the period the project required the skills of Scala, partially Ruby(for testing). Also, in the project Jenkins, Auto-Testing and Regression Test became part of my skills. Along with this, Unix(Mac OSX)-based development, Vim/Tmux-based coding, and Functional Programming improved my mindset as engineer drastically. The guru I worked with taught me the collection handling (fold, map, reduce), anonymous function, lazy variable, and else. In addition, I've learnt LISP programming in this period, Reverse Polish Notation. 

## Mail Publishing System

  Since 2015, the maintenance and development of the Mail Publishing System was my job. The system was made in PHP. For it previously had no tests(the former engineers manually tested the system simply copying and pasting excel data inputs). Contribution of mine to this system was establishing test automation module and its libraries. These codes were mainly composed of Python. Once you added new test data as configuration/DSL, it is included in the already-existed test patterns, and the test engine automatically interprets the regression/unit tests. Those are executed sequentially. Respecting(not harming) indigenous codes, which had been totally verbose, I implemented functionally with PHP. Along with this, there were tasks of mine to develop a few PHP-based systems acquiring skills and knowledges of Zend framework, Fuel Php, and Web Interface coding.

## Point System

  Since around November 2015, current team leader assigned me to the the Point System Development Project, including product requirement and design phases.
It was totally categorized as the water-fall project. The system is implemented in Java. In the project, English is officially forbidden in any documents / comments.
Aside from coding and designing/product requirement, I was assigned to the Database/ Data syntax denominating task.
Almost 95% of the documents were excel. The problem of it was, once a part of system definition altered, team members, opening each excelled documents one by one,
had to modify the relating part of the documents manually. It was a waste-time job. Therefore my passion to make elements as mutually exclusive as possible enforced
me to utilize Confluence as Wiki, created dictionary(one term, one page). Initially team managers declined my proposals, but they finally evaluated my Wiki-based document
managing strategy and assigned me the job for the Wiki management. In the project no functional coding was allowed and each developers coded abiding by the OOP rule.


## Payment Gateway

This company, as startup in Thailand, has many highly-edged developers talented in specific fields. I was involved in the project such as:

  - Cash Management Japan (Offsite Convinience Store payment)
  - Cash Management Singapore(Singaporean Batch Transfer Backend implementation)
  - Reconciliation System
  - GPG encrypt_sign/decrypt_verify module implementation

and irregular tasks as:

  - CAFIS operation
  - Reviewing of API documentation translation from English to Japanese by occupational translator.
  - Expense Sheet auto generation script creation 

I developed the systems above in Ruby on Rails and knowledge on how the payment gateway (credit transaction) works. 
Since Sales Team had difficulty with communicating with the developers in the Headquarters, I had many chances to intermediate between them. During this period I have learned regex is crucial apparatus for reducing our costs for development. My coding and development speed and skills increased drastically during this period thanks to the coworkers.
